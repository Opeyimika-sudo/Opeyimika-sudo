<h3>Meet Me</h3>

Hi, I'm Opeyimika. I am a full-stack software engineer. I have ideas. I know how to write code. I am on a mission to build products that people use, love and share with their friends.

I have written code in languages and used frameworks just as Thanos gathered the infinity stones. I love writing JavaScript and Python.
