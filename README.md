<h3>Meet Me</h3>

- 👋 Hi, I’m Opeyimika, a Full-Stack Software Engineer. I come from a healthcare background, but my head is buried in code, and my heart is thirsty to understand the fundamentals and hungry to solve difficult problems. 


- 👀 I build front-end and back-end projects that delight and solve the problems of users. 
- 🌱 I’m currently solidifying my knowledge of ReactJS, learning TypeScript and writing [articles](https://opeyimikaaremu.hashnode.dev/) on what I'm currently learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, network with like-minded people and ultimately form meaningful friendships.
